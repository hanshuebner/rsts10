.SBTTL	EMLDEF  --  Notes on EMLCTL control cells

;	The EMT Logger's table of control cells is defined in the
;  TBL.MAC assembly at SYSGEN time.  If EMT Logging was not selected
;  (by "EMTLOG" being defined in CONFIG.MAC), the table consists of
;  a single cell (EMLRIB, at offset 0), and will contain a constant
;  "zero" to signify "EMT Logging not active".  In addition, the global
;  JCEMLP will be set to "NOEML";  SND tests against this when determining
;  whether or not to allow the special processing to declare an EML receiver
;  and to set up the other control cells.

;	If EMT Logging was selected, the other cells are defined in TBL,
;  and JCEMLP is globalized to be the proper JCR offset for EML's "pending
;  packet" pointer.
