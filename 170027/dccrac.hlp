The CREATE/ACCOUNT command creates a new account and defines the
attributes for the account.

For additional information about RSTS/E accounts, see the help topic
ACCOUNTS.

Format:

     CREATE/ACCOUNT [dev:][p,pn]

You must specify either the device specification or PPN.  The default
value for dev:  is _SY0:  and the default PPN is your PPN.  You can
include wildcards and ranges in the PPN specification.

Privileges required:

     WACNT to create any account.
     GACNT to create an account in your own group.  

*/CAPTIVE
*|/NOCAPTIVE
  /CAPTIVE
  /NOCAPTIVE

  Determines the way in which a job under this account exits.

  When you specify /CAPTIVE, the system expects the job to remain
  totally under control of a predetermined procedure, such as a
  login command procedure or a menu processor.  If you attempt to
  exit to the keyboard monitor, the monitor removes the job.  

*/CLUSTER_SIZE
  /CLUSTER_SIZE=n

  Specifies the number of 512-byte blocks that each cluster
  allocated to the account's directory contains.  Once you specify
  the UFD cluster size you cannot change it unless you delete the
  account and create it again.

  An account can have a maximum of seven clusters;  therefore, the
  UFD clustersize affects the maximum number of files that you can
  store in the account.  This maximum value is further affected by
  the size of each file, its cluster size and attributes.  

*/DETACHED_JOB_QUOTA
  /DETACHED_JOB_QUOTA=n

  Specifies the maximum number of jobs that can exist in a detached
  state for this account at one time.  The range for n is 0 to 63 or
  UNLIMITED.

  The default is /DETACHED_JOB_QUOTA=0.

  For additional information about job quotas, see the QUOTAS topic.

*/DIALUP
*|/NODIALUP
  /DIALUP
  /NODIALUP

  Indicates whether the system allows logins from dial-up lines.
  The default is /DIALUP.  

*Examples

  $CREATE/ACCOUNT/IN_QUOTA=5000 _DR3:[2,240]

       Creates account [2,240] on disk drive _DR3:  and specifies a
       logged in disk quota of 5000 blocks.

  $ CREATE/ACCOUNT/TEMPLATE=_DR3:[1,214] [3,213]

       Creates account [3,213] on the public disk structure and
       specifies that the account's attributes are to be those of
       account [1,214] on disk drive _DR3:.

*/EXPIRE
*|/NOEXPIRE
  /EXPIRE
  /EXPIRE=date-spec
  /NOEXPIRE

  Determines when you can initiate jobs under the account.

  When you specify an expiration date, it is the last date on which
  you can initiate a job under the account.  The account expires at
  the end of the specified day.

  When you specify /EXPIRE without a date specification, the system
  never allows you to initiate a job under the account.

  When you specify /NOEXPIRE, the account never expires.  

*/IN_QUOTA

  Specifies the number of disk blocks the system allows you to

  directive UU.CRE.  No logins, either interactive or otherwise, are
  allowed.  Batch jobs, however, are still allowed.  

*/JOB_QUOTA

                               to the middle of the disk

*/TEMPLATE
  /TEMPLATE=dev:[p,pn]

  Specifies the account, the attributes of which you want to use for
  the default attributes of the account you are creating.

  You must specify either the device specification or the PPN.  The
  default for dev:  is _SY0:  and the default PPN is your PPN.

  The specified account's password, size, and position are not part
  of the defaults for the new account.  

*/USER
*|/NOUSER
  /USER
  /NOUSER

  Indicates whether the account should contain user attributes, such
  as a password or privileges.  Specify /NOUSER if the account is to
  be used only for storing files.  Generally, all accounts created
  on a private disk are non-user accounts, while most accounts on
  the system disk are user accounts.

  See the topic ACCOUNTS for further information about user and
  non-user accounts.

  If you do not specify /USER or /NOUSER, then the default is based
  on the presence of certain qualifiers, or the type of disk where
  the account is being created.

  If you include a qualifier that implies a user account, such as
  /PRIVILEGE, then /USER is assumed.  Otherwise, the account's disk
  type determines the default.  For accounts created on the system
  disk, /USER is assumed.  For disks mounted private, /NOUSER is
  assumed.

  Note that you are not prompted for a password when creating
  non-user accounts.
