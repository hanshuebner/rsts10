The SET ACCOUNT command modifies the parameters of one or more
accounts on a disk you specify.

Format:

     SET ACCOUNT dev:[p,pn]

You can omit either the device specification or the PPN, but not both.
The default device specification is _SY0:.  The default PPN is your
own.

You can specify wildcards and ranges in the PPN specification.  RSTS/E
uses all qualifiers that apply to a specific account.

If no qualifiers apply to a selected account, the account is not
modified.

For additional information about accounts, see the help topic
ACCOUNTS.
