The COPY command duplicates one or more existing files.  You can copy
one input file to another output file, merge one or more input files
into a single output file, or copy a group of input files from one
account or device to another account or device.

If you use the COPY command to copy files across the network, all of the
input files must reside on the same network node.  

Format:

     COPY  [node::]input-file-spec[,...]  [node::]output-file-spec

For information about complete file specifications, see the FILES topic.

Privileges required:

     Read access to each input file.

     Create/rename access to the output file.

     If superseding a file, write access to that file.

     When using /PROTECTION, SYSIO and write access to the output file
     to set the privilege bit <128> in the protection code for
     non-executable files (files with the execute bit <64> NOT set in
     their protection code)

     When using /PROTECTION, TMPPRV and write access to the output file
     to set the privilege bit <128> on programs (files with the execute
     bit <64> set in their protection code) 

*/ALLOCATION
  /ALLOCATION=n

  Pre-allocates n 512-byte blocks to the output file.  If you don't
  specify this qualifier, the the output file allocation is the same
  as the input file size.

  You can use this qualifier only if both the input and output files
  are on your network node.

*/BEFORE
  /BEFORE=date

  Indicates that you want to copy only those files created (/CREATED)
  or modified (/MODIFIED) before the specified date.  The date can be
  any valid DCL absolute or relative date string.  For additional
  information, see the DATES topic.

  You cannot use this qualifier if you specify a network node name in
  either the input or output file specification.

*/BLOCK_SIZE
  /BLOCK_SIZE=n

  Specifies the block size (in bytes) of an output file copied to
  magnetic tape.  The value of n is any even integer in the range of
  18 to 4096.  The default is /BLOCK_SIZE=512.

  The maximum block size is 2048 when copying files to an
  ANSI-formatted tape intended for use on another operating system.

  You must use a block size of 512 if you want to use the output tape
  on an RT-11 operating system.

*/CLUSTER_SIZE
  /CLUSTER_SIZE=n

  Specifies the cluster size of an output file copied to a disk.  Use
  a large clustersize to reduce the amount of directory overhead and
  speed access to a large file.

  The value of n must be a power of two in the range -256 to 256,
  depending on the type of disk.  When you specify a cluster size, the
  system uses the absolute value of the argument specified or the
  output disk pack cluster size, whichever is greater.  Specifying
  /CLUSTER_SIZE=0 assigns a cluster size equal to the pack cluster
  size for the disk where the output file resides.  

  The default is to use the input file cluster size when copying from
  a disk file, or the output disk pack cluster size when copying from
  a nondisk file.

  You cannot use this qualifier if you include a node name in either
  the input or output file specification.  

*/CONFIRM
*|/NOCONFIRM
  /CONFIRM
  /NOCONFIRM

  Indicates whether the system prompts you for confirmation before
  copying each file.  The /CONFIRM qualifier is useful only when you
  use wildcards in the input file specification.  The default is
  /NOCONFIRM.  /CONFIRM acts functionally the same as /QUERY.

  Your response to the prompt can be Y (copy the file), N (don't copy
  the file), <RET> (don't copy the file), or CTRL/Z (skip the
  remaining files).  

*/CONTIGUOUS
*|/NOCONTIGUOUS
  /CONTIGUOUS
  /NOCONTIGUOUS

  Indicates whether the output file copied to a disk is to be
  contiguous.  A contiguous file occupies consecutive physical disk
  blocks.

  The default is to create a contiguous output file if the input file
  is contiguous and there is sufficient contiguous space on the output
  disk to do so.  Otherwise, the file is created noncontiguous.

  If you are concatenating several input files, or if the single input
  file is not a disk file and you are creating a contiguous output
  file, you must also use the /ALLOCATION qualifier to pre-allocate
  enough disk space for the output file.  If you do allocate output
  file space or if the allocation is too small, the system cannot
  extend the output file and you receive an error message.

  You cannot use this qualifier if you include a node name in either
  the input or output file specification.

*/CREATED
  /CREATED

  Indicates that you want to copy only those files created before
  (/BEFORE) or since (/SINCE) the specified date.  The date can be any
  valid DCL absolute or relative date string.  For additional
  information, see the DATES topic.  This qualifier conflicts with the
  /MODIFIED qualifier.

  You cannot use this qualifier if you include a node name in either
  the input or output file specification.

*Examples

  $ COPY/LOG [10,10]TEST.DAT *
  [File SY:[10,10]TEST.DAT copied to _SY:[1,240]TEST.DAT]

       Copies the contents of the disk file TEST.DAT located in
       account [10,10] on the public disk structure to the file
       TEST.DAT in your account on the public disk structure and
       displays a confirming log message.

  $ COPY MYFILE.LOG THERE::*
  Node:     THERE
  User:     1,240
  Password: 
  Account:  
  SY:[1,240]MYFILE.LOG copied to THERE::DR3:[1,240]MYFILE.LOG.

       Copies the contents of file MYFILE.LOG from your account on the
       local node to a file named MYFILE.LOG in your account on node
       THERE::.

*/LOG
*|/NOLOG
  /LOG
  /NOLOG

  Indicates whether the COPY command displays the file specification
  of each file copied.  The default is /LOG.  

*/MODIFIED
  /MODIFIED

  Indicates that you want to copy only those files modified before
  (/BEFORE) or since (/SINCE) the specified date.  The date can be any
  valid DCL absolute or relative date string.  For additional
  information, see the DATES topic.  This qualifier conflicts with the
  /CREATED qualifier.

  You cannot use this qualifier if you specify a network node name in
  either the input or output file specification.

*/OVERLAY
*|/NOOVERLAY
  /OVERLAY
  /NOOVERLAY

  Indicates whether the data in the input file replaces any data in an
  existing output disk file.  Use the /OVERLAY qualifier when you want
  to replace the contents of a file without altering its directory
  information.  The default is /NOOVERLAY.

  If the input file is smaller than the output file, the excess data
  in the output file remains intact.

  You can use this qualifier only when the input and output files are
  on your own node.

*/POSITION
  /POSITION=position

  Specifies the starting position of the output file on the disk.  The
  position can be any integer in the range of zero to the maximum disk
  cluster number, INDEX, or MIDDLE.

  If you specify an integer, the file is stored at the first available
  position after the specified cluster number.

  If you specify INDEX, the file is stored at the first available
  position after the master file directory index.

  If you specify MIDDLE, the file is stored at the first available
  position after the middle of the disk.

*/PROTECTION
  /PROTECTION=protection-code

  Specifies the output file protection code.  You cannot use this
  qualifier if you use the /OVERLAY qualifier or if you copy across
  the network.

  By default, RSTS assigns output files a protection code of 60,
  unless your system manager changes the default.  In addition, if you
  use the SET PROTECTION/DEFAULT command before using the COPY
  command, the protection code assigned is the specified default
  value.

  You can use this qualifier only if both the input and output files
  are on your own network node.

*/QUERY
*|/NOQUERY
  /QUERY
  /NOQUERY

  Indicates whether the system prompts you for confirmation before
  copying each file.  The /QUERY qualifier is useful only when you use
  wildcards in the input file specification.  The default is /NOQUERY.

  Your response to the prompt can be Y (copy the file), N (don't copy
  the file), <RET> (don't copy the file), or CTRL/Z (skip the
  remaining files).  

*/REPLACE
*|/NOREPLACE
  /REPLACE
  /NOREPLACE

  Indicates whether the system replaces an existing file that has the
  same file specification as the output file specification.

  If you specify /NOREPLACE and a file having the specified output
  file specification exists, the COPY command fails.

  If you do not specify either /REPLACE or /NOREPLACE and a file
  having the specified output file specification exists, COPY prompts
  you.  Your response to the prompt can be Y (replace the file), N
  (don't replace the file), or <RET> (don't replace the file).

  When you use the COPY command in a command procedure, specify either
  /REPLACE or /NOREPLACE to prevent COPY from issuing the prompt.

*/RETAIN_DATES
*|/NORETAIN_DATES
  /RETAIN_DATES
  /NORETAIN_DATES

  Indicates whether the output file should retain the input file's
  creation date and time and date of last access/modification, or use
  the current date and time.  Use /RETAIN_DATES to retain the input
  file's dates.  Use /NORETAIN_DATES to use the current date.  The
  default is /NORETAIN_DATES.

*/SELECT
  /SELECT=SIZE=n
  /SELECT=SIZE=MINIMUM=n
  /SELECT=SIZE=MAXIMUM=n
  /SELECT=SIZE=(MINIMUM=m,MAXIMUM=n)

  Indicates the selection criteria you want to use, based on the
  file's size.

  Use /SELECT=SIZE=n to select only those files whose size is equal to
  n.

  Use /SELECT=SIZE=MINIMUM=n to select only those files whose size is
  greater than or equal to n.

  Use /SELECT=SIZE=MAXIMUM=n to select only those files whose size is
  less than or equal to n.

  Use /SELECT=SIZE=(MINIMUM=m,MAXIMUM=n) to select only those files
  whose size is between m and n inclusive.  

*/SINCE
  /SINCE=date

  Indicates that you want to copy only those files created (/CREATED)
  or modified (MODIFIED) since the specified date.  The date can be
  any valid DCL absolute or relative date string.  For additional
  information, see the DATES topic.

  You cannot use this qualifier if you specify a network node name in
  either the input or output file specification.  

*/TRANSFER_MODE
  /TRANSFER_MODE=keyword

  Specifies the method by which the file(s) are transferred to or from
  a remote node.  Valid keywords are BLOCK, RECORD, and AUTOMATIC.

  /TRANSFER_MODE=BLOCK causes the file to be transferred as binary
  data consisting of 512-byte blocks.  This mode of transfer is
  generally faster than record mode;  however, it is only valid for
  RSTS-to-RSTS file transfers.  If the remote node is not a RSTS
  system, the transfer will be attempted using record mode.

  /TRANSFER_MODE=RECORD copies the file as a collection of records
  based on the file record format.

  /TRANSFER_MODE=AUTOMATIC causes the most suitable mode of transfer
  to be selected automatically.  This is the default.

  You cannot use this qualifier unless you specify a network node name
  in either the input or output file specification.
