The SET PROTECTION command specifies the protection code for a file.

Format:

     SET PROTECTION[=]n filespec[,...]

You must specify a protection code and a file specification unless you
use the /DEFAULT qualifier, in which case you need only specify a
protection code.

You can specify one or more file specifications and you can include
wildcard characters.

Use the DIRECTORY/PROTECTION command to learn the current protection
code for your files.

Privileges required:

     Create/Rename access to the file you specify

     SYSIO and write access to file to set the privilege bit <128> in
     the protection code for non-executable files (files with the
     execute bit <64> NOT set in their protection code)

     TMPPRV and write access to file to set the privilege bit <128> on
     programs (files with the execute bit <64> set in their protection
     code)

See the FILE PROTECTION topic for additional information about RSTS/E
file protection codes.

*/BEFORE
  /BEFORE=date

  Indicates that only files created (/CREATED) or modified
  (/MODIFIED) before the specified date have their protection set.
  The date can be any valid DCL absolute or relative date string.
  See the DATES topic for additional information.

*/CONFIRM
*|/NOCONFIRM
  /CONFIRM
  /NOCONFIRM

  Indicates whether the system prompts you for confirmation before
  setting the protection code for each file.  This qualifier is
  useful only if you use wildcards in the file specification.  The
  default is /NOCONFIRM.  /CONFIRM acts functionally the same as
  /QUERY.

  Your response to the prompt can be Y (change the protection code),
  N or <RETURN> (don't change the protection code), or CTRL/Z (skip
  the remaining files).

*/CREATED
  /CREATED

  Indicates that only files created before (/BEFORE) or since
  (/SINCE) the specified date have their protection set.  The date
  can be any valid DCL absolute or relative date.  This qualifier
  conflicts with the /MODIFIED qualifier.

*/DEFAULT
  /DEFAULT

  Specifies the protection code assigned to every file you create
  until you log out.  Do not include a file specification when you
  use this qualifier.

  To disable the user default protection and return to the system
  default, perform a SET PROTECTION/DEFAULT command without
  specifying a protection code.

*Examples

  $ SET PROTECTION=42 FIXIT.*

       Assigns a protection code of 42 to all files named FIXIT and
       having any file type.

  $ SET PROTECTION=40/DEFAULT

       Assigns the default protection code of 40 to all files you
       create until you log out.

*/LOG
*|/NOLOG
  /LOG
  /NOLOG

  Determines whether the PROTECTION command displays a confirming
  message on your terminal for each file whose protection code you
  change.  Do not use this qualifier with the /DEFAULT qualifier.
  The default is /LOG.  

*/MODIFIED
  /MODIFIED

  Indicates that only files modified before (/BEFORE) or since
  (/SINCE) the specified date have their protection set.  The date
  can be any valid DCL absolute or relative date.  This qualifier
  conflicts with the /CREATED qualifier.

*/QUERY
*|/NOQUERY
  /QUERY
  /NOQUERY

  Indicates whether the system prompts you for confirmation before
  setting the protection code for each file.  This qualifier is
  useful only if you use wildcards in the file specification.  The
  default is /NOQUERY.  

  Your response to the prompt can be Y (change the protection code),
  N or <RETURN> (don't change the protection code), or CTRL/Z (skip
  the remaining files).

*/SELECT
  /SELECT=SIZE=n
  /SELECT=SIZE=MINIMUM=n
  /SELECT=SIZE=MAXIMUM=n
  /SELECT=SIZE=(MINIMUM=m,MAXIMUM=n)

  Indicates the selection criteria you want to use, based on the
  file's size.

  Use /SELECT=SIZE=n to select only those files whose size is equal
  to n.

  Use /SELECT=SIZE=MINIMUM=n to select only those files whose size
  is greater than or equal to n.

  Use /SELECT=SIZE=MAXIMUM=n to select only those files whose size
  is less than or equal to n.

  Use /SELECT=SIZE=(MINIMUM=m,MAXIMUM=n) to select only those files
  whose size is between m and n inclusive.  

*/SINCE
  /SINCE=date

  Indicates that only files created (/CREATED) or modified
  (/MODIFIED) since the specified date have their protection set.
  The date can be any valid DCL absolute or relative date.  See the
  DATES topic for additional information.
